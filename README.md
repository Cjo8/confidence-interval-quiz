## 🎓 Understanding Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval is a range of values that estimate the true value of a population parameter. For instance, a 95% confidence interval suggests that if we were to take many samples, 95% of them would contain the true average. This tool helps you understand these concepts clearly and practically through quizzes.
